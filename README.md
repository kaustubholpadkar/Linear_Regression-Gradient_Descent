# Linear Regression - Gradient Descent - Octave
[Linear regression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) with One variable using [Gradient descent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) in Octave

## Description
This project demonstrates how the gradient descent algorithm may be used to solve a linear regression problem.
<br/>
<br/>
A small dataset of student test scores and the amount of hours they studied is utilized. Intuitively, there must be a relationship between the scores and the hours studied. The more one studies, the better one's test scores should be. The linear regression is used to uncover this relationship.
<br/>
<br/>
There are several numerical optimization techniques amongst which the Gradient Descent method is examined to minimize the cost function of Linear Regression.
