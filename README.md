# Linear Regression - Gradient Descent - Octave
[Linear regression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) with One variable using [Gradient descent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) in Octave

## Description
This project demonstrates how the gradient descent algorithm may be used to solve a linear regression problem.
I'm using a small dataset of student test scores and the amount of hours they studied. Intuitively, there must be a relationship right? The more you study, the better your test scores should be. We're going to use linear regression to prove this relationship.
